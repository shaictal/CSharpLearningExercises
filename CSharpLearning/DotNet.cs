/*
 * CLR(Common Language Runtime)
 *
 * Offers services such as:
 * Security
 * Memory Management
 * Exception Handling
 */

/*
 * FCL(Framework Class Library)
 *
 * A collection of re-usable classes, interfaces, and value types

                                        //Managed vs Unmanaged Code


/*
* Managed code
* C# compilers create
* Runs on the CLR
* offers Garbage Collection
*/

/*
 * Unmanaged code
 * Compiles straight to machine code
 * not managed by the CLR

                                        //Boxing vs Unboxing


/*
 * Boxing is the process of converting a value type to the type object
 * int i = 123;
 * object o = i;
 */

/*
 * Unboxing is the process of extracting the value type from the object
 * o = 456;
 * i = (int)o;
